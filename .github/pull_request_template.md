## Type of PR

- [ ] Bugfix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Minor changes

## Running the demo

In order to run the included demo app, run `yarn run bootstrap` and then `cd demo` and run both `npx react-native run-android` and `npx react-native start` in parallel.

## Review checklist for new or updated modules

Please go through the following checks:

- [ ] I have made no modules changes - ignore this section questions in that case
- [ ] I have included a `meta.json` file in the module's root directory
- [ ] I have included a `preview.png` image in the module's root directory
- [ ] `yarn run parse` checks pass
- [ ] I updated the modules build (`/dist` directory) with `yarn run dist`

React Native modules specific checks:

- [ ] `yarn run demo` and `yarn run add app-menu <your-module>` runs correctly
- [ ] **"Running the demo"** app shows the App Menu screen with an entry for your module
- [ ] Clicking your module entry in the menu loads your module's initial screen correctly

Django modules specific checks:

- [ ] `python manage.py show_urls` shows that the module's urls are resolved correctly
- [ ] I have checked that the migrations are detected and run correctly

If your module is a "supermodule" and therefore contains both React Native and Django code, then please go through all of the checks above.

## Review checklist for scaffold changes

- [ ] I have made no scaffold changes - ignore this section questions in that case
- [ ] `yarn run template` produces no changes
- [ ] `yarn run raw && yarn run cookie` produces no changes, except for `yarn.lock`
- [ ] `yarn run demo` finishes successfully, `demo` directory gets created locally
- [ ] **"Running the demo"** opens the app correctly in the welcome screen
