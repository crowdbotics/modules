## Getting started

Welcome to your new Crowdbotics app.

### Metro

After cloning the repo, install the dependencies locally with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```sh
yarn install
```

Start your [Metro](https://facebook.github.io/metro/) server:

```sh
npx react-native start
```

### Android

```sh
npx react-native run-android
```

### iOS

```sh
pod install --repo-update --project-directory=ios
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Setup react-native-vector-icons

Follow instructions at their [README.md](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons/blob/master/README.md#installation)

## Running with Fastlane

[Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) makes testing, building, and deploying apps
easier.

Install fastlane globally (`npm i -g fastlane` or `yarn i -g fastlane`).
Android and iOS dependencies are the same as React Native CLI.

All fastlane commands are run from the platform directory. For example, Android
commands must be run from `android/`. Fastlane should be executed using `bundle exec` to ensure dependencies are managed correctly.

The commands for Android and iOS are the same:

- Run tests: `bundle exec fastlane tests`
- Local build: `bundle exec fastlane build`
- Build and upload a beta (requires signing): `bundle exec fastlane beta`
- Build or promote a release: `bundle exec fastlane deploy`

### Android

Publish an Android app you must first create an app in the Play Console and
manually upload an APK. After the first upload run `bundle exec fastlane supply init` from `android/` to sync with the Play store. All future releases will be
uploaded automatically.

Android uses tracks. A beta release will build the app and upload to the beta
track. Deploying will promote from beta to production.

### iOS

CB developers must follow fastlane's [codesigning guide](https://codesigning.guide/) for using match.
Match will automatically sign iOS builds.

New CB developers should get access to the codesigning repo and run `bundle exec fastlane match development` from `ios/`.

Not a CB developer? Create an [Apple developer](https://developer.apple.com)
and follow the instructions on [codesigning guide](https://codesigning.guide/)
to setup your certificates.
