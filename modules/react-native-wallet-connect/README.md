## Features

# Connect to Crypto Wallets

useWalletConnect hook and WalletConnectProvider from @walletconnect/web3-provider package are used to allow users to connect to a wallet of their choosing.
The following piece of code allows to connect to wallet
```
const connector = useWalletConnect();
connector.connect()
```
# Kill Session

Users can kill the session which would direct them to the Home screen, where they could connect with another wallet 
The following piece of code allows to Kill the session.
```
connector.killSession()
```
# Switch Session

Users can also switch session, thereby switching from one crypto wallet to another.

# Send Funds

Users can send funds from the connected amount to another account. To this end, Web3 Apis were made use of. The user has to scan a QR code generated by the receivers's crypto wallet in order to get his/her account id. 
The following code enables the user to send funds 
```
  const tx = {
      from: ...,
      to: ...,
      gas: ...,
      value: ...,
    }
    web.eth.sendTransaction(tx)
```

# Receive Funds

Users generate a QR code which contains their account id. The sender needs the QR code to acquire the account id in order to for him to send the funds

 # Transaction History

 A log of transactions is maintained all along.
 

 # RPC

 WalletConnectProvider object has to be configured in order to make successful request to the crypto wallets for importing account details. For this this purpose, RPC protocol needs to be configured for WalletConnectProvider to allow request to crypto wallets.
The following depicts the configuration
 ```
 new WalletConnectProvider({
    rpc: {
      97: 'https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/', 
      43113: 'https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc',
