## Installation
1. On the Firebase console, add a new Android application and enter your projects details. The "Android package name" must match your local projects package name which can be found inside of the manifest tag within the /android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml file within your project.

2. Download the google-services.json file and place it inside of your project at the following location: /android/app/google-services.json.

3. Add the google-services plugin inside of your /android/build.gradle file:
```
buildscript {
    repositories {
   
    google()  // Google's Maven repository

  }

  dependencies {

    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.10'
   
  }
}

  allprojects {

  repositories {

    google()  // Google's Maven repository

  }
}
```

4. Lastly, execute the plugin by adding the following lines of code to your /android/app/build.gradle file:

```
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'

dependencies {

  implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:30.1.0')
