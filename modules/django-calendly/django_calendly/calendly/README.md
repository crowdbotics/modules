### Subscription Object
webhooks with the v2 API, can be used to receive real-time Calendly meeting data at a specified URL, when an event is scheduled or canceled. 
The organization subscription scope triggers the webhook for all subscribed events within the organization.

 ```java
 {
     url : 'https://{base_url}/modules/calendly/webhook-url/', //The URL where you want to receive POST requests for events you are subscribed to.
     events: [                     //List of user events to subscribe to.
    "invitee.created",
    "invitee.canceled"
    ],
    organization: 'https://api.calendly.com/organizations/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA' //The unique reference to the organization that the webhook will be tied to.
    scope: 'organization'          //Indicates if the webhook subscription scope will be "organization" or "user"
 }
 ```
