## Manual Setup

1. If you want to use the module directly, or in other modules, you can do so by importing it and using the following properties.

```javascript
import Chat from "@modules/chat";

const { title, navigator } = Chat;
```

2. You can call module directly by importing navigator without going through any routing. And pass the params to the module.

```javascript
import { modules } from '@modules';
const Chat = modules[module_index].value.navigator;  //module_index : position of the module in modules folder
<Chat />
```
