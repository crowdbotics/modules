# Terms & Conditions Screen

The Terms and Conditions Screen is a ReactNative based screen that leverages the webview with a simple header.

## Installation

After you have added the screen module into your project, you will need to configure a few items by modifying the project
files in the github repository. Please note to replace ####### with the numeric sequence for your screen (found in folder name under /src/features) and also that the @BluePrint tags for ImportInsertion and NavigationInsertion will be removed in future so placement is with other imports and inside the AppNavigator above other screens.

### STEP 1: Add dependency library to the project.

**/PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORY/package.json:**

**ADD** Dependency after Line 16 (dependencies opening line "_"dependencies": {_ ")

`"react-native-webview": "^10.8.2",`

### Step 2: Add screen into your project screen navigation.

**/src/mainNavigator.js:**
**ADD** immediately below in the section labeled //@BlueprintImportInsertion:

`import TermsAndConditions#######Navigator from '../features/TermsAndConditions#######/navigator';`

**ADD** immediately below in the section inside AppNavigator definition labeled //@BlueprintNavigationInsertion section:

`TermsAndConditions#######: { screen: TermsAndConditions#######Navigator },`

### STEP 3: Add Terms screen into the sidemenu navigation.

**/src/config/installed_blueprints.js**
**ADD**
Make sure any screens that arenâ€™t desired in the side menu are removed from the file.

In installed_blueprints.js you need to add objects for every screen that you want to show in the sidemenu/splash screen.
They have a specific format:

`{ name: 'TermsAndConditions#######', human_name: 'Terms & Conditions', access_route: 'TermsAndConditions#######'}`

**name:** doesn't matter much, its used as a unique key for the side menu and splash screens array of
buttons, it must be unique, that's the only requirement

**human_name:** is what will be displayed in actual app

**access_route:** must be the name of the key in your mainNavigator setup

### STEP 4: Set the left arrow screen redirect.

**/src/features/TermsAndConditions######/screens/index.js:**

**MODIFY** Line 161 (replace HomeScreen177788 with your desired Home/return screen name:

`<TouchableOpacity style={{ padding: 5 }} onPress={() => { this.props.navigation.navigate('HomeScreen177788') }}>`
